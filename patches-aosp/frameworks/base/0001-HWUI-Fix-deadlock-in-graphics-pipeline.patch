Subject: [PATCH] HWUI: Fix deadlock in graphics pipeline

Mutex lock() causes deadlock when the queue is empty.
Regression is caused by b013c8dee3b3e897b3557206f2d6c75b8c9f2f84
For some unknown reason, it is reproduced only on GloDroid :)
So probably some other part of GD is to blame.
Or, it is just a coincidence.

TODO: Do one more investigation attempt.
